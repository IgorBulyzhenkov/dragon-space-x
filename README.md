To enter the main pages of the site, you need to register. I implemented protection against non-existent boxes. After registration, a letter will be sent to the indicated address in which you need to confirm your identity. If the letter is not visible in the "Inbox" folder - you need to check the "Spam" folder, if there is nothing in it - a button will appear on the site with which you can send the letter again. The site is adapted for all types of devices, starting with mobile and ending with the desktop version. There is also a link to my LinkedIn in the footer of the website, I will be glad to see you among my friends.

## Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

Before starting the project locally, first you need to do npm install in order to install all the libraries from package.json

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
